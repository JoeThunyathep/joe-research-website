title: OGC ISG SPRINT (2020)
summary: The OGC Interoperable Simulation and Gaming (ISG) Sprint aims to advance the use of relevant OGC and Khronos standards in the modeling and simulation community through practical exercise and testing of the draft specification produced by the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot. In this pilot, I involved as a 3D web app developer from Steinbeis Stuttgart and developed a 3D web platform "STT 3D Geoportal Client" as shown in figures below.

## Goal

The goal of the Sprint was to advance the use of relevant OGC and Khronos standards in the modeling and simulation community through practical exercise and testing of the draft specification produced by the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot (and the associated YouTube Playlist). Of particular interest was the handling and integration of glTF models coming from multiple sources. There was secondary interest in the spec's implementability, consistency, completeness, and maturity. Implementation experiences obtained from the Sprint advanced the interests and work of the OGC Interoperable Simulation and Gaming Domain Working Group (ISG DWG) and of the OGC Standards Baseline in general.

## Who

This initiative was sponsored by U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Proposals from both OGC members and non-members were considered, and nine organizations were selected for participation. Stipend funding was provided to selected OGC members.

## What

The event was a week-long, virtual coding sprint that prototyped organization-chosen features. A single prototype of the entire spec was not feasible, but collectively the team reached as far as possible. Here is the original Call for Participation.

The 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot project was built upon work from Testbeds 13 through 15, 3D Tiles, and I3S; combined with the introduction of resource-oriented OGC APIs built on the OpenAPI framework. These provided the foundation for the draft specification that was the test subject of the Sprint.

Several OGC members participated in the Pilot along with the OGC, Khronos Group, and an initiative sponsor to develop the draft spec. This spec allows 2D assets (maps, vector graphics), building data, and 3D assets (glTF models, OGC building models, digital elevations) to be used together to produce a synoptic view of the region in question.
