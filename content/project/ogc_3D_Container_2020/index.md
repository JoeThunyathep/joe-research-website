title: OGC 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot (2020)
summary: The goal of the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot is to explore an integrated suite of draft specifications for 3D tiled geospatial resources and compatibility with existing OGC 3D delivery standards such as the 3D Portrayal Service, I3S, and 3D Tiles Community Standard. This suite will support smooth transitions between 2D and 3D environments; allow applications working with 2D tiled resources to get 3D tiled resources; and enable 3D tile bounding volumes to support multiple data containers.

## Goal

The goal of the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot is to explore an integrated suite of draft specifications for 3D tiled geospatial resources and compatibility with existing OGC 3D delivery standards such as the 3D Portrayal Service, I3S, and 3D Tiles Community Standard. This suite will support smooth transitions between 2D and 3D environments; allow applications working with 2D tiled resources to get 3D tiled resources; and enable 3D tile bounding volumes to support multiple data containers.

To achieve these goals, the Pilot will develop a draft API that is compatible with the OGC API group of standards (and candidate standards) and which allows access to, and query of, 3D geospatial data and a corresponding container format for streamed data delivery compatible with glTF. The Pilot funds a number of data server and client implementations to test the new API and data delivery. Further, the Pilot will include an analysis of characteristics and capabilities of the new API in comparison with existing or emerging 2D standards.
