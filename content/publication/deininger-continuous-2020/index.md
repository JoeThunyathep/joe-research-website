abstract: 'The concept and implementation of Smart Cities is an important approach
  to improve decision making as well as quality of life of the growing urban population.
  An essential part of this is the presentation of data from different sources within
  a digital city model. Wind flow at building scale has a strong impact on many health
  and energy issues in a city. For the analysis of urban wind, Computational Fluid
  Dynamics (CFD) has become an established tool, but requires specialist knowledge
  to prepare the geometric input during a time-consuming process. Results are available
  only as predefined selections of pictures or videos. In this article, a continuous,
  semi-automated workflow is presented, which ❶ speeds-up the preparation of CFD simulation
  models using a largely automated geometry optimization; and ❷ enables web-based
  interactive exploration of urban wind simulations to a large and diverse audience,
  including experts and layman. Results are evaluated based on a case study using
  a part of a district in Stuttgart in terms of: ➀ time saving of the CFD model preparation
  workflow (85% faster than the manual method), ➁ response time measurements of different
  data formats within the Smart City platform (3D Tiles loaded 30% faster than geoJSON
  using the same data representations) and ➂ protocols (3DPS provided much higher
  flexibility than static and 3D container API), as well as ➃ subjective user experience
  analysis of various visualization schemes of urban wind. Time saving for the model
  optimization may, however, vary depending on the data quality and the extent of
  the study area.'
