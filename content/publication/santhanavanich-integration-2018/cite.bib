It allows interconnections among a wide variety of devices and sensors such as smartphones, smartwatches, automobiles, or any object with a built-in sensor. However, these devices and sensors are developed by numerous different manufacturers which leads to technology lock-in in terms of data formats and protocols. In order of address this heterogeneity, an interoperable sensor protocol is the need of the hour. To address this, we propose a sensor data management system for monitoring \textitpedelec usage and user fitness level. Using a proof-of-concept prototype the study is carried out in downtown of Stuttgart city. The result of the integrated analyzed data is visualized in 3D digital globe CESIUM.\textless/p\textgreater},
