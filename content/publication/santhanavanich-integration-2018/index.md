  According to the advances in Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT), nowadays,
  the use of Internet of Things (IoT) has become a normal part of daily life. It allows
  interconnections among a wide variety of devices and sensors such as smartphones,
  smartwatches, automobiles, or any object with a built-in sensor. However, these
  devices and sensors are developed by numerous different manufacturers which leads
  to technology lock-in in terms of data formats and protocols. In order of address
  this heterogeneity, an interoperable sensor protocol is the need of the hour. To
  address this, we propose a sensor data management system for monitoring textitpedelec
  usage and user fitness level. Using a proof-of-concept prototype the study is carried
  out in downtown of Stuttgart city. The result of the integrated analyzed data is
  visualized in 3D digital globe CESIUM.textless/ptextgreater
