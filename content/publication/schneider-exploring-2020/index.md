abstract: Abstract. In this paper various schemes for visualizing geo-spatial data
  such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data are explored. The architecture of
  a new Smart Cities Platform is presented and examples of the visualization capabilities
  are given. Results show that scalar and vectorial measurands, such as wind pressure
  and wind directions, may be presented using the same schemes, however, interpretation
  of the visualization varies between measurands. A hex-grid representation of the
  highly dense point cloud data yields easier interpretation of the scene as do streamlines
  for visualizing a path of flow over and around buildings. Results of performance
  evaluations suggest that the same visualisation scheme (e.g. hex-grid) but different
  data formats, yields faster loading times when using 3D Tiles rather than GeoJSON
  and an overall smoother interaction within the application.
