abstract: Abstract. The latest coronavirus (namely severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 or COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China, and spread throughout
  the world since December 2019. To tackle this pandemic, we need a tool to trace
  and predict trends of COVID-19 at global, national, and regional levels rapidly.
  Several organizations around the world offer access to COVID-19 related data. However,
  these data sources are heterogeneous in terms of data formats and protocols as different
  organizations developed them. To address this issue, a standard way to handle these
  datasets is needed. In this paper, we propose using the OGC SensorThings API to
  manage the COVID-19 dataset in a standard form and provide access to the general
  public. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a COVID-19 data management platform
  based on the OGC SensorThings standard named COVID-19 SensorThings or in short COVID-STA.
  For a use case, we developed a real-time interactive web-based dashboard illustrating
  the COVID-19 dataset based on the COVID-STA. As a result, we proved that the OGC
  SensorThings API is suitable to use as a general standard for integrating the heterogeneous
  COVID-19 data.
