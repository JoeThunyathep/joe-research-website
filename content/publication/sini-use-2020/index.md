abstract: Abstract. As the world continues in the quest to fight global warming and
  environmental pollution by gradually moving to renewable sources of energy, there
  is also a need to reduce building energy consumption by refurbishing old and historic
  buildings to meet the required energy standards. While this approach may differ
  from city to city across the globe, the refurbishment of old and historic buildings
  would make a significant impact. That is why it is necessary to educate building
  owners or occupants by simulating the existing energy consumption and proposing
  appropriate refurbishment strategies. Because the accuracy of energy simulation
  is directly proportional to the amount of data available and its reliability, there
  is a need to find creative ways of supplying incomplete or missing building information.
  The present paper describes a concept that enables individual building occupants
  or owners to provide this missing information. Implemented and tested with the 3D
  city model of Aachen, the proof-of-concept enables individual building owners or
  occupants to perform energy simulations based on energy information supplied.
