abstract: Abstract. The recent advancement in Information &amp; Communication Technology
  (ICT) is seen as a critical enabler to design intelligent smart cities targeting
  different domains. One such domain is modes of transport in a city. Currently, various
  cities around the world are envisioning innovative ways to reduce emissions in the
  cities by increasing physically active mobility. However, there is still limited
  information about the safety of cyclists and pedestrians within city limits. To
  address this, we develop a 3D web-based safe routing tool called Vision Zero. Our
  concept prototype used Augsburg city, Germany, as a case study. The implementation
  is based on open-source tools. In the back-end, the OGC 3D Portrayal Service standard
  helps to deliver and integrate various 2D and 3D geospatial contents on a web-based
  client using CesiumJS. The OGC SensorThings API (STAPI) standard is used to manage
  historical and real-time open road-incident data from the Federal Statistical Office
  of Germany. The navigation system is built up based on the routing engine pgRouting,
  which calculates the safest route based on the mentioned STAPI server and the road-network
  dataset from OpenStreetMap.
