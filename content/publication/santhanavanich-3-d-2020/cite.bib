 abstract = {Abstract. The recent advancement in Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) is seen as a critical enabler to design intelligent smart cities targeting different domains. One such domain is modes of transport in a city. Currently, various cities around the world are envisioning innovative ways to reduce emissions in the cities by increasing physically active mobility. However, there is still limited information about the safety of cyclists and pedestrians within city limits. To address this, we develop a 3D web-based safe routing tool called Vision Zero. Our concept prototype used Augsburg city, Germany, as a case study. The implementation is based on open-source tools. In the back-end, the OGC 3D Portrayal Service standard helps to deliver and integrate various 2D and 3D geospatial contents on a web-based client using CesiumJS. The OGC SensorThings API (STAPI) standard is used to manage historical and real-time open road-incident data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. The navigation system is built up based on the routing engine pgRouting, which calculates the safest route based on the mentioned STAPI server and the road-network dataset from OpenStreetMap.},
