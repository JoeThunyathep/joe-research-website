	abstract = {Devices from the Internet of Things are being increasingly used in everyday life, and they provide a massive amount of data in various formats. While implementing the Smart Cities initiative, these data are integrated and utilized together with the 3D city model for further applications. Based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards, heterogeneous sensor data can be integrated with the Open Geospatial Consortium SensorThings Application Programming Interface. Similarly, the 3D city model data can be stored and exchanged with the Open Geospatial Consortium CityGML format. However, currently, there is no concrete model to integrate these sensor data with the 3D city model using the Open Geospatial Consortium standards. The existing solution for integrating the sensor data into the 3D city model requires an extension or plug-in for adding the data to the CityGML model. In this paper, we introduce the concept of “CityThings” to integrate dynamic sensor data from the Open Geospatial Consortium SensorThings API into the CityGML 3D city models. We demonstrate the implementation of the CityThings concept in the Smart Villages project in the study area of Wüstenrot, Germany, by integrating dynamic sensor data from several systems including solar panels, agro-thermal plants, and weather monitoring sensors to visualize the sensor data with the 3D city model on the web platform. In the future, this concept can be applied to interconnect dynamic sensor data and 3D city model data in other Smart Cities applications.},

	abstract = {The concept and implementation of Smart Cities is an important approach to improve decision making as well as quality of life of the growing urban population. An essential part of this is the presentation of data from different sources within a digital city model. Wind flow at building scale has a strong impact on many health and energy issues in a city. For the analysis of urban wind, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become an established tool, but requires specialist knowledge to prepare the geometric input during a time-consuming process. Results are available only as predefined selections of pictures or videos. In this article, a continuous, semi-automated workflow is presented, which ❶ speeds-up the preparation of CFD simulation models using a largely automated geometry optimization; and ❷ enables web-based interactive exploration of urban wind simulations to a large and diverse audience, including experts and layman. Results are evaluated based on a case study using a part of a district in Stuttgart in terms of: ➀ time saving of the CFD model preparation workflow (85\% faster than the manual method), ➁ response time measurements of different data formats within the Smart City platform (3D Tiles loaded 30\% faster than geoJSON using the same data representations) and ➂ protocols (3DPS provided much higher flexibility than static and 3D container API), as well as ➃ subjective user experience analysis of various visualization schemes of urban wind. Time saving for the model optimization may, however, vary depending on the data quality and the extent of the study area.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The recent advancement in Information \&amp; Communication Technology (ICT) is seen as a critical enabler to design intelligent smart cities targeting different domains. One such domain is modes of transport in a city. Currently, various cities around the world are envisioning innovative ways to reduce emissions in the cities by increasing physically active mobility. However, there is still limited information about the safety of cyclists and pedestrians within city limits. To address this, we develop a 3D web-based safe routing tool called Vision Zero. Our concept prototype used Augsburg city, Germany, as a case study. The implementation is based on open-source tools. In the back-end, the OGC 3D Portrayal Service standard helps to deliver and integrate various 2D and 3D geospatial contents on a web-based client using CesiumJS. The OGC SensorThings API (STAPI) standard is used to manage historical and real-time open road-incident data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. The navigation system is built up based on the routing engine pgRouting, which calculates the safest route based on the mentioned STAPI server and the road-network dataset from OpenStreetMap.},
